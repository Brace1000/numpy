# numpy
## Overview
This Project involves the **practical usage of NumPy**, Pythonâ€™s most widely used package for numerical computing and data analysis.

## Requirements ##
- Perform array creation, slicing, and manipulation efficiently.
- Use NumPy for data simulation and statistical analysis.
- Handle missing data and apply broadcasting techniques.
- Work with real-world datasets using NumPy.

NumPy has been around since the mid-2000s (evolving from *Numeric*). Its stability and speed make it the foundation of modern data science libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **TensorFlow**.

## Learning Objectives 
- Master fundamental NumPy operations.
- Manipulate and analyze numerical data effectively.
- Extract insights from structured datasets.
- Gain confidence in using NumPy as a foundation for machine learning workflows.


## Environment Setup

### Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 (training) or latest stable release
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Jupyter/JupyterLab
- **Tools**: Virtual environment manager (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`)


### Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment named `ex00` with Python 3.8.
2. Install NumPy and Jupyter(If not installed)
3. Save installed packages:
```bash
   $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
 - While on the terminal, run:
 ```bash
 $ jupyter notebook --port 8891
 ```
